NOTE: changed backend server to cherrypy and to do so installed with pip install the wsgiserver
installed cherrypy-wsgiserver using this repo https://github.com/od-eon/cherrypy-wsgiserver
and copied the wsgiserver folder to the C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\CherryPy-12.0.1-py2.7.egg\cherrypy folder
in order to see the functions


for each client it produces a unique log


for agent to start give command line argument -agent and to stop it ctrl+c and it needs a different terminal
time interval is given in minutes



(?) the iocs refering to ip addresses and domains



installed ioc_parser (https://github.com/armbues/ioc_parser) through pip and through downloading and python setup.py install
but on windows coundn't see the package and i had to rename first the file iocp (C:\Users\Stratarxis\Downloads\ioc_parser-master\ioc_parser-master\bin)
to iocp.py and then move it one folder up in order to see the folder iocp which was needed to run



changed file C:\Users\Stratarxis\Downloads\LoRa\server\ioc_parser\iocp\Output.py to create yara file in the same directory



changed openioc_to_yara in order to parse the iocs of mine and produce correct yara rules and extend its functionality
e.g. recognize the size of file and check its hash


installed openpyxl to precess excel files
