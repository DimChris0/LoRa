NOTE: changed backend server to cherrypy and to do so installed with pip install the wsgiserver
installed cherrypy-wsgiserver using this repo https://github.com/od-eon/cherrypy-wsgiserver
and copied the wsgiserver folder to the C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\CherryPy-12.0.1-py2.7.egg\cherrypy folder
in order to see the functions

Update on cherrypy: using only pip install cherrypy worked for an installation on a VM,
but because there is a migration from wsgiserver to cheroot i installed CherryPy using
the following command   pip install "cherrypy>=3.0.8,<9.0.0"


for agent to start give command line argument -agent and to stop it ctrl+c
time interval is given in minutes


installed ioc_parser (https://github.com/armbues/ioc_parser) through pip and through downloading and python setup.py install
but on windows coundn't see the package and i had to rename first the file iocp (C:\Users\Stratarxis\Downloads\ioc_parser-master\ioc_parser-master\bin)
to iocp.py and then move it one folder up in order to see the folder iocp which was needed to run


installed openpyxl to precess excel files
